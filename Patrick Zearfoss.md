Pat has been without a doubt one of the best tech leaders I had the luck to work with.

Clear, on point, unambigous about his intention and expectations on the dev team. Also, knowledgable on iOS as a whole in the use of its tools and technologies, the community and the business sphere.

Iâ€™ll gladly work with him again in the future.
