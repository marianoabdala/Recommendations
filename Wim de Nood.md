I don’t think I’ve ever seen Wim get upset. Seems like he’s ready to tackle whatever you throw his way and accept the responsability as a challenge regardless of the difficulties involved. In my opinion that’s the kind of dev that shines when the project is running smoothly and that you can rely on when it’s not.

I’ve seen him going from zero to knowing a decent amount of Core Data incredibly fast and even giving me some tips I wasn’t aware of.

Great guy to work with, I hope our paths cross again in the future.
