[Gonzalo Larralde](http://stackoverflow.com/users/225589/gonzalo-larralde)

I've known Gonzalo for over 2 years, he's a valued member of the NSCoder Buenos Aires, which I host; and has also been a great speaker at the NSConfArg, which I organise. 

Not long ago I had the chance of working briefly with him on solving a truly bizarre crash on one of my private projects (soon to be released). He proved to be one of the most resourceful developers I've ever met. He took the lead on exploring the possible causes for the issue with a variety of tools that I didn't even known to exist and finally found the cause for the issue. 

Once this was achieved, we planned a suitable course of action to isolate the user from it, since the issue was located on a closed library and we couldn't find any workaround online. 

I'd be more than happy to work with him again.
