When iOS 7 came out I promptly devoted myself to writing an app specially tailored for it. I was simply blown away with its fresh and focused design. 

A few days after I submitted my app, I got an email from Apple stating that I only had 24 hours left to submit the promotional artwork for my app (meaning it was being considered for promotion), it turns out that the original email with the 48 hours deadline was marked as spam by Apple's email client itself. 

In a burst of excitement and having to comply with a tremendous deadline to meet I called Carlos and explained the scenario. This was for me an opportunity of a lifetime, but I needed a world-class banner for my app in now 12 hours. 

Carlos delivered a simple and clear, yet colourful and playful banner for me to submit to Apple. 

A few days later I learnt that my app was being featured as Designed for iOS 7 and that Carlos' banner was being used *untouched* as a promotion. 

Sometimes Apple's designers introduce little changes to the banners to make them look better, but not this time. This time, it was perfect.
